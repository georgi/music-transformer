# Music Transformer with ðŸ¤— Transformers

This project implements the Music Transformer, a powerful attention-based neural network for generating long pieces of music with improved long-term coherence. The Music Transformer is built using the Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers library, specifically the LLaMA model, which allows for efficient training and generation of high-quality music.

The model is trained using PyTorch Lightning for efficient and scalable training, and Hydra is employed for configuration management.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a combination of the Lakh MIDI Dataset and/or the MAESTRO dataset, providing a diverse collection of musical pieces for learning the structure and patterns in music.

## Features

- Utilizes the powerful LLAMA model from the Hugging Face Transformers library
- Trains the model using PyTorch Lightning for efficient and scalable training
- Employs Hydra for configuration management, making it easy to experiment with different settings
- Supports training on the Lakh MIDI Dataset and the MAESTRO dataset
